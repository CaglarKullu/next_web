# Responsive Flutter Web

A Flutter package designed to simplify the creation of responsive web applications. With a mobile-first approach, this package combines adaptive layouts, breakpoints, a grid system, and fractional-sized boxes to provide an intuitive and easy-to-use toolset for developers.

## Features

- **Breakpoints**: Predefined breakpoints similar to CSS for better layout control.
- **Adaptive Layouts**: Easily define different layouts for mobile, tablet, and desktop sizes.
